 Finally caught up with this film from earlier this year. A lot of my favorite critics had this in their top-films-of-2014 lists, but I don't think it quite cracked it for me. I thought it was a well-made, atmospheric film. It elevated the otherwise pedestrian stuff that we've seen featuring vampires in the last 5-7 years. A depressed vampire is a pretty funny premise. And I liked that it featured Detroit as a character. I'm pretty fascinated by that city, and its slow death.

But it never crossed into another level for me. It's answer for "why is life worth living," wasn't 100% believable or compelling. Maybe I expect too much when someone tries to answer that question, but if you're gonna try to answer a big question like that, you better come up with some big answers.
