 Glad a movie actually took on and featured teenage alcoholism in a real way. 

During graduation one of the characters says to Sutter (the protagonist) "well, we made it." I immediately thought about how there's no real accomplishment mile-markers like that after high school and college graduation. As an adult, things just happen in sequence, with no real sense of separation or accomplishment. I think this makes decision making as an adult more difficult. Not a new thought of course, but a feeling this movie stirred in me.
