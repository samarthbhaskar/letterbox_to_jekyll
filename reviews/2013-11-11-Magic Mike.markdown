 Kind of reminded me of Soderbergh's earlier explorations of sex and sexuality in SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE but with a more contemporary, OCEAN'S 11-y approach. This was sex for the MTV generation. SEX, LIES, and VIDEOTAPE was a more cerebral exploration or sex. Still, fun to see what a good director can do with otherwise mediocre material, acting, etc.
