 First Polanski I've seen in a long long time. And it totally blew me away. What a fantastic film, every detail was impressive. Nicholson, Dunaway and even the supporting cast all did some great work here. 

This film felt ultra-modern even though it was made in 1974. In some ways it felt as fresh as Kubrick's 2001 even though films in these genres have been made for decades after their release. 

It was hard not to think about Polanski the man while appreciating Polanski the director. Especially near the end of the film when the final huge plot detail is revealed, I couldn't help but wonder if those are thoughts Polanski has had himself about young women. I'm still torn about supporting artists like Polanski, Woody Allen and Bill Cosby. It makes it all the more difficult when they make incredible work like this.
