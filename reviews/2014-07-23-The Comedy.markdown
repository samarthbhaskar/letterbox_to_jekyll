 A fine performance by Tim Heidecker, but I fear this film about irony never really says anything meaningful about the topic. 

I was reminded of the David Foster Wallace quote about irony [1] and how it is a dangerous thing. Once you use irony or sarcasm to debunk something, or point out a flaw, then what? It should be incumbent upon you to at least try an offer an alternative.
