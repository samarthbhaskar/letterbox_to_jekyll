 My biggest problem: overwrought exposition. Ham-handed writing. A character named Mann to tell us about the folly of man. C'mon, Nolan, give me more credit as a audience member.

The film is beautiful. The score is fantastic. The actors do a bang-up job. But ultimately it falls apart because of Chris and Jonathan Nolan's directing and writing. The film made me wish for Gravity's simplicity, for 2001's focus and for Inception's execution. 

Bummer this didn't end up being one of my favorites of the year. I was looking forward to it.
