 I remember seeing _Garden State_ in high school and really loving it. I re-watched it after I learned how to watch film, and it completely fell flat on its face. This movie won't take 2 viewings to confirm that. Braff is a college freshman, stuck in some Philosophy 101 repetitive loop about happiness, confidence, family and whatever other amorphous topic you can throw at it.

Mandy Patinkin spent the first half of his career as Inigo Montoya, and now will spend the second half as Saul Berenson. It's too bad because he's actually got a lot to offer.
