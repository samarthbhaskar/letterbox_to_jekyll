 Seeing this after seeing PTA's later work (There Will Be Blood and The Master) took away some of the magic that I might have felt if I saw this when it first arrived. It is nothing short of amazing. PTA made nothing short of a masterpiece, but he has matured so much since this film that I can't quite put this at #1 on my PTA list. 

None the less, its a magnificent story, structured well, cast perfectly, directed with patience and executed flawlessly. Even Mark Wahlberg has enough support around him to pull of the job of a lead actor without having the chops to really do it.
