 I fear Fassbender + McQueen handled this topic better in Shame. I was impressed with what Von Trier had to say about depression in Melancholia but I'm not as taken with what he has to say about sex and guilt in this film. I suppose to should watch Vol. II to complete the story, but there's hardly anything bringing me back.

Still, it was beautiful. And despite being heavy handed I liked the conversations between the protagonists telling the story through conversation.
