 A great duo performance, made me think of Phoenix + Hoffman from The Master (certainly less virtuosic though). Teller is very talented and so is JK Simmons' face and voice. I'm usually not a big band jazz lover but I loved every piece of music in this film. I've been watching youtube compilations of drummers since I saw it. A great film!
