 Saw this over brunch at Nighthawk in Williamsburg. This movie is too strange to work, I thought at the beginning, but by the end I didn't want it to stop. Both characters were perfect, their harmony was perfect. A real treasure of a film.

I think Maude could have been treated as a little more of an independent person, outside the definition of taking care of Harold or being his guide to a fuller life. This is mostly a half-baked thought though, not a real complaint. 

And of course the opposite (old man, young woman) would've been super controversial. Gender is exhausting sometimes.
