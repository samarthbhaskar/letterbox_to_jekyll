 What a beautiful, wonderful film. It could've been all about the "it took 12 years to make this movie" gimmick, but it went way beyond that. No real huge plot twists and turns, no stories to follow - except the story of life. Linklater created a narrative in the most shapeless place. 

I'm an Indian-American immigrant who grew up in New Delhi and Illinois, and this movie, about a white Texas family, feels like my story. That's a marvelous accomplishment.
