 Marin Ireland is a much better actress than Chris Messina, turns out. But both of them together are not good enough to carry a film like this. The "improvised" scenes were awkward, overbearing and clumsy. They probably could've been tightened up with a better script or maybe a better director. I think one or two more re-writes and this would've been a much better film.

It's like writing an article or a book. Films are never finished either. You can always edit a little more. This one came out of the even just a little too early.
