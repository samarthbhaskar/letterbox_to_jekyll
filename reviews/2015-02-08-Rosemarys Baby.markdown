There is so much going on in this film, but it still keeps its center and forward motion. Of all the allusions and themes, my favorite is Polanski's take on femininity. Polanski digs into some the frustrations of pre-modern and modern femininity.

The tension built by the single-location shoot, the details in each apartment, the aesthetic impact of clothing, furniture and other details really puts this film in a category of its own. Although most of the actors carry the movie very well, I was most impressed with John Cassavettes. He brought, at once, a gravity and buoyancy to his role that elevated the film.

Admittedly, I haven't seen many films from this era, but starting in on Polanski's oeuvre has made me excited about seeing more great works from the 50s, 60s and 70s. I've spoken on here before about my discomfort with watching works by people who have pretty clearly been awful people in their lives, but for now I'm casting that aside and basking in his genius.
