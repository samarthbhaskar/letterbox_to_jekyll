 Selma is one of the best films of the year. And much like The Kings Speech it snuck in near the end of the year to, likely, sweep a lot of Oscars. However, unlike The Kings Speech, I think this film will stand the test of time much better.

DuVernay stepped up to the challenge of directing this film and knocked it out of the park. She paid homage to Attenborough's Gandhi, and Gandhi himself, in choices like having a news reporter narrate and emotionally carry the audience through a major scene (Bloody Sunday). She also never lost a site of history in the story, bringing Washington, Gandhi, Jackson and many other figures into the film.

No performance (save maybe Oprah's) was off point. All the actor's in the film, it seemed, knew the weight of what they were doing and they, like their director, rose to the challenge.
