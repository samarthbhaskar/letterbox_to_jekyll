 I liked this film, but not as much as a lot of people liked it last year. The film was very well cast, including Maggie Gyllenhaal (about whom I cannot stop thinking after Honorable Woman binges). But the out and out winner in the cast is Fassbender. Even including his turns in the recent X-Men films, he has yet to really disappoint. Although seeing him play a lovable, although broken, character - I just wanted more of him as the despicable, scary types he plays in Steve McQueen films.
