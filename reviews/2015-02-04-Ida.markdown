 One of the few critically-acclaimed films that I missed last year. All the praise for its cinematography was spot on. The landscapes, portraits of characters faces, spacing between character who were interacting and framing of buildings and rooms was impeccable. The film could've gotten away with just studying all the grays in our world, alone. 

And, unfortunately, in terms of substance, it doesn't go far beyond there. The 2nd and 3rd act don't build up enough substance to really carry this film from beautiful to meaningful. But as others have said, maybe that's just because this film is about Ida's first act. And although we see her aunt's final act, the film is much less interested in that.
