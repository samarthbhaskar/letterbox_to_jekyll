 I expected at first to be wow-ed, then depressed, then shocked, then affected, but pretty much none of those things happened. This film made me think about character, and who we present to the word, the mask we wear (not unlike the Kabuki-esque white mask Lila has on at the beginning of this film). The energy this movie emits, rather seeps out, about teenage need for acceptance is probably more in line with how sad that need for acceptance is than most other movies on that topic.
