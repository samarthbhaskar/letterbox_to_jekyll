During graduation one of the characters says to Sutter (the protagonist) ""well, we made it."" I immediately thought about how there's no real accomplishment mile-markers like that after high school and college graduation. As an adult, things just happen in sequence, with no real sense of separation or accomplishment. I think this makes decision making as an adult more difficult.

This movie is too strange to work, I thought at the beginning, but by the end I didn't want it to stop. Both characters were perfect, their harmony was perfect. A real treasure of a film.

I think Maude could have been treated as a little more of an independent person, outside the definition of taking care of Harold or being his guide to a fuller life. This is mostly a half-baked thought though, not a real complaint.

This film made me think about character, and who we present to the word, the mask we wear (not unlike the Kabuki-esque white mask Lila has on at the beginning of this film). The energy this movie emits, rather seeps out, about teenage need for acceptance is probably more in line with how sad that need for acceptance is than most other movies on that topic.",,2014-08-10
2014-08-25,The One I Love,2014,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-one-i-love-2014/,3.5,"The writing, direction and acting was really great - especially the first 3 acts. I fear the movie sets up a question it just can't answer by the final act. 

Duplass deserves all the praise he's receiving for his work in this film, he quickly won me over on screen and kept my respect throughout. I don't know if the fact that he helped produce this movie is completely unrelated. I think he took this role more seriously than past work. Moss, on the other hand, was effective at best. 

What I've said so far makes it sound like I didn't enjoy the movie. But don't let me fool you - I enjoyed this movie a lot. The two protagonists carried the film throughout, the dialog was crisp and poignant, the themes evergreen and what the writer had to say about those themes original and worthwhile. ",,2014-08-24

But both of them together are not good enough to carry a film like this. The ""improvised"" scenes were awkward, overbearing and clumsy. They probably could've been tightened up with a better script or maybe a better director. I think one or two more re-writes and this would've been a much better film.

It is nothing short of amazing. PTA made nothing short of a masterpiece, but he has matured so much since this film that I can't quite put this at #1 on my PTA list. 

None the less, its a magnificent story, structured well, cast perfectly, directed with patience and executed flawlessly. Even Mark Wahlberg has enough support around him to pull of the job of a lead actor without having the chops to really do it.",,2014-09-14

2014-10-12,"Men, Women & Children",2014,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/men-women-children/,3,"Maybe Reitman will never make anything like Juno or Up In The Air, ever again. That's a sad thought. 

In physics, related to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, there is an idea that we cannot study something without it changing. I think Reitman tried too early to study the effects of electronic communication on people's lives. I think these effects are still in flux and we don't quite have a grasp on what's happening just yet. Or if we do, Reitman didn't really present it in a convincing way.

His directorial fingerprints, though, were all over the film and made it enjoyable. 

For some reason, I can never take Jennifer Garner seriously. She is not a good actress, in this humble viewer's opinion.

But still, a fine entry in this year's increasingly awesome set of films.",,2014-10-10
2014-10-14,Inherent Vice,2014,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/inherent-vice/,4,"I need to see this film about 3 more times before I figure out how to feel about it. But then again, I felt that way about There Will Be Blood and The Master, both of which are squarely near the top of my all-time favorites. However, it is very possible that this movie isn't meant for the same kind of understanding. I don't think it has the same meaningful ideas to deliver about its topic.

First impressions: so many details, so many plot points to follow. At times it felt like reading Heidegger while tripping. Which made me realize, maybe this is PTA's attempt at portraying what the world feels like when your relationship to it (like the protagonist's) is heavily doped up. Was Joaquin Phoenix on screen literally the whole time? Because his performance was light and silly, does it make it any less of an achievement than Daniel Day Lewis being on screen the whole time in There Will Be Blood?

In the PTA filmography, this felt a lot more like Boogie Nights (not least because it's around the same era) than The Master or There Will Be Blood. Although Boogie Nights was way more ambitious in trying to capture big ideas about porn/money/industry while Inherent Vice just asks questions (like The Master).

Maybe PTA is moving in a post-modern or historicist direction as he moves forward as a film maker. Inherent Vice felt like a real product of the era is it was set in. Cultural references, lighting choices, the gritty details on each character's face and body were all spot on. But situating a question in its historical context is not the same as answering that question.

The real failure of post-modernism was that it got really good at asking questions, but never at answering them in any satisfactory way. I hope PTA doesn't fall prey to that same failure. ",,2014-10-12
2014-10-19,Birdman,2014,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/birdman/,3,"This is bound to be a polarizing film. It seems to me the best way to observe this film is to be keenly aware that you're sitting in a theater, watching artists talk about art. If you don't keep that frame of focus in mind, its easy to miss (what I think is the point) of the film.

One clear success was bringing Ed Norton back up in my list of favorite all time actors. Embarrassing to admit now but American History X was one of my first loves in film in high school. For a long time I considered Ed Norton to be my favorite actor. 25th Hour helped keep him there. But for a long time he has made safe choices and hasn't seemed to grow. This movie threw that pattern out of the window. He did a fantastic job in a challenging role.

Keaton, too, was a strong point in this movie. He carried a disjointed, maniacal, schizophrenic film by being just as maniacal and schizo. 

I liked the things it had to say about criticism. For what its worth, my favorite commentary on criticism is Pixar's Ratatouille. 

Overall, though, this might just get thrown in the closet with the many attempts artists have made at commenting on art itself. After a while, all that commentary just seems self-congratulatory and like they want is to bloviate at length about a tired topic. The majority of people in the world are not artists, take a risk, learn something about them, say something new about them.",,2014-10-17
2014-10-28,Kill Bill: Vol. 1,2003,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/kill-bill-vol-1/,3.5,Had myself a Kill Bill 1 & 2 viewing last night. Totally great.,,2014-10-26

2014-11-02,Nightcrawler,2014,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/nightcrawler/,4,"I had a lot of fun watching Nightcrawler. Gyllenhaal is definitely at the top of his game here. Even his face is more gaunt, which adds to the overall creepiness of this character. His assistant, played by Riz Ahmed (who was great in Four Lions), was one of my favorite characters as well. Although I could do without Hollywood's repeated use of Latino/South Asian actors to play the mismatched Latino/South Asian parts.

I sometimes get a little tired of LA as a character in films, because it seems so navel-gazy, but this film used LA properly. Night-time LA has a Michael Mann sort of feel to it and it came out beautifully in this film. And watching Los Angeles Plays Itself last year gave me a new appreciation for why LA has been so important to Hollywood films.

Besides all the juicy character and plot stuff, this movie was a pretty sardonic take on modern ambition and achievement. The things Gyllenhaal and Russo's characters do, and how little/flimsy push back they get are pretty scathing critiques of success in the modern economy. The film has a lot to say about media consumption, production and I liked that it balanced all that well with a great story and fascinating characters.

I'm not sure this film will stand up to some of the other great 2014 releases, but it's definitely a strong addition to my growing list of 2014 favorites.

2014-11-11,Interstellar,2014,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/interstellar/,3,"My biggest problem: overwrought exposition. Ham-handed writing. A character named Mann to tell us about the folly of man. C'mon, Nolan, give me more credit as a audience member.

The film is beautiful. The score is fantastic. The actors do a bang-up job. But ultimately it falls apart because of Chris and Jonathan Nolan's directing and writing. The film made me wish for Gravity's simplicity, for 2001's focus and for Inception's execution. 

Bummer this didn't end up being one of my favorites of the year. I was looking forward to it.",,2014-11-08
2014-12-07,Force Majeure,2014,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/force-majeure-2014/,3.5,"Among the better foreign films I've seen this year. I liked the questions and provocations it offered about nature, human nature, gender, marriage and modernity. I think the actors did a good job keeping the writing front and center, creating a dark atmosphere and making me feel just weird enough that my attention was captured the whole time. The director, also, did his part in making me uncomfortable from beginning to end, which helped carry the message for this film.

I'm glad Tomas, the father, came to a place by the end of the film where he was comfortable being himself. It's unfortunate that who he ended up being was not really too impressive a man.

The breakdown Tomas has about 2/3 of the way through the movie, is something I've wondered about myself. Will I be proud of the man I grow up to be? I'm sure there will be regrets and habits that I'm not proud of, but hopefully, in the large sense, I can be proud of the man, father, husband I end up being. I think I knew a few fathers, husbands, older men in my life who don't feel very proud of who they ended up being. And institutions like marriage, parenthood, work, masculinity don't make it easy to confront that and change it.",,2014-12-06
2014-12-14,Top Five,2014,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/top-five/,3.5,"Top Five ended up being way funnier than I expected, and also way more real. I don't think this movie would've been possible without Louis CK and ""Louie"" in particular. I'm really glad Chris Rock took his encouraging words and wrote a really meaningful movie. This is definitely the first ""great Chris Rock movie"" as others have said. The cameo, in itself, was a character in the film. And all the cameos were hilarious, some even more than others. Some of the stories this film tells had to have happened in real life to Chris Rock, there's no way he just made that up. 

I'm glad he didn't try to say anything huge or expansive about fame or creativity, he just shared his thoughts based on experiences he has had as a long time artist, and I bought it. Rock has always reminded me of those awkward, lanky, sinewy men I know in my life, who rarely jump out of their shell. But somehow Rock eschewed that character type, became a hugely successful entertainer and this movie is proof that it wasn't an accident. All of this happened to Chris Rock because he has a big heart and a big brain in that otherwise lanky, awkward, sinewy body of his.",,2014-12-13
2014-12-30,Only Lovers Left Alive,2013,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/only-lovers-left-alive/,3,"Finally caught up with this film from earlier this year. A lot of my favorite critics had this in their top-films-of-2014 lists, but I don't think it quite cracked it for me. I thought it was a well-made, atmospheric film. It elevated the otherwise pedestrian stuff that we've seen featuring vampires in the last 5-7 years. A depressed vampire is a pretty funny premise. And I liked that it featured Detroit as a character. I'm pretty fascinated by that city, and its slow death.

But it never crossed into another level for me. It's answer for ""why is life worth living,"" wasn't 100% believable or compelling. Maybe I expect too much when someone tries to answer that question, but if you're gonna try to answer a big question like that, you better come up with some big answers.",,2014-12-28
2014-12-30,Life Itself,2014,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/life-itself/,5,"This film meant a lot to me, because Roger Ebert meant a lot to me. Ebert played a big role in getting me into cinema, into making films more than just entertainment or cultural currency. We also have some biographical similarities. I grew up in Central Illinois, attended the University of Illinois, went to University of Chicago for grad school and called Chicago home for a while. I've since departed, but still Chicago a big part of my identity.

When I saw Steve James, someone I admire a lot for both The Interrupters and Hoop Dreams, was tapped to make this film, I couldn't find my wallet fast enough to donate to the effort. 

To Ebert, movies were empathy generating machines. To me, Ebert's writing and his contribution to bringing movies to the masses amplified that empathy far beyond its original reach.",,2014-12-28

And much like The Kings Speech it snuck in near the end of the year to, likely, sweep a lot of Oscars. However, unlike The Kings Speech, I think this film will stand the test of time much better.

DuVernay stepped up to the challenge of directing this film and knocked it out of the park. She paid homage to Attenborough's Gandhi, and Gandhi himself, in choices like having a news reporter narrate and emotionally carry the audience through a major scene (Bloody Sunday). She also never lost a site of history in the story, bringing Washington, Gandhi, Jackson and many other figures into the film.

No performance (save maybe Oprah's) was off point. All the actor's in the film, it seemed, knew the weight of what they were doing and they, like their director, rose to the challenge. ",,2015-01-01
2015-01-28,Frank,2014,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/frank-2014/,3,"I liked this film, but not as much as a lot of people liked it last year. The film was very well cast, including Maggie Gyllenhaal (about whom I cannot stop thinking after Honorable Woman binges). But the out and out winner in the cast is Fassbender. Even including his turns in the recent X-Men films, he has yet to really disappoint. Although seeing him play a lovable, although broken, character - I just wanted more of him as the despicable, scary types he plays in Steve McQueen films. ",,2015-01-24
2015-01-28,Nebraska,2013,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/nebraska/,3.5,"I missed this 2013 hit in the year it came out. 2013 was quiet a year, with the likes of Zero Dark Thirty, Lincoln, Django, Beasts of the Southern Wild and Amour all competing for top honors. I don't think Nebraska belonged up there next to some of those films, but it certainly deserved more praise than Argo. 

Bruce Dern was very impressive in this role. It didn't ask much of him in the way of physical feats or dialog delivery, but it seemed his internal ticking was right in line with what the character called for. Some of the looks on his face, and his reactions to the cast showed a real understanding of this character.

This film also captured midwestern/fly-over-state sadness really well. Central IL isn't as desolate as Montana, Wyoming and Nebraska, but I still feel very blue there when I return. Nebraska captured those blues perfectly.

**woops, just realized it competed in 2014. Well, most of my points still stand.**",,2015-01-27
2015-02-01,Chinatown,1974,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/chinatown/,5,"First Polanski I've seen in a long long time. And it totally blew me away. What a fantastic film, every detail was impressive. Nicholson, Dunaway and even the supporting cast all did some great work here. 

This film felt ultra-modern even though it was made in 1974. In some ways it felt as fresh as Kubrick's 2001 even though films in these genres have been made for decades after their release. 

It was hard not to think about Polanski the man while appreciating Polanski the director. Especially near the end of the film when the final huge plot detail is revealed, I couldn't help but wonder if those are thoughts Polanski has had himself about young women. I'm still torn about supporting artists like Polanski, Woody Allen and Bill Cosby. It makes it all the more difficult when they make incredible work like this.",,2015-01-31
2015-02-04,Ida,2013,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/ida/,4,"One of the few critically-acclaimed films that I missed last year. All the praise for its cinematography was spot on. The landscapes, portraits of characters faces, spacing between character who were interacting and framing of buildings and rooms was impeccable. The film could've gotten away with just studying all the grays in our world, alone. 

And, unfortunately, in terms of substance, it doesn't go far beyond there. The 2nd and 3rd act don't build up enough substance to really carry this film from beautiful to meaningful. But as others have said, maybe that's just because this film is about Ida's first act. And although we see her aunt's final act, the film is much less interested in that.",,2015-02-02
2015-02-04,Enemy,2013,http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/enemy/,3,"There are some interesting actor-director pairings in recent years that I've enjoyed. Fassbender+McQueen, Goslin+Winding Refn, DiCaprio+Scorcese, among many others. This pairing between Gyllenhaal and Villeneuve seems like a junior varsity version of that. So far at least. Both Enemy and Prisoners seemed like they were a draft of edits away from a tighter, more capturing film. Maybe they'll both stick at it and come out with better stuff in the near future.

I could've also done with some cinematographic and color diversity in this film. Maybe the whole thing was supposed to feel like one nightmare in one person's head, but it was too monotonic after a while. 

Gyllenhaal put in a strong performance though. A character very dissimilar from his Nightcrawler character, but played with a similar level of depth.",,2015-02-03
