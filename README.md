# Export letterbox reviews

I needed to export my [letterboxd.com](http://letterboxd.com/) reviews and add them to my jekyll [blog](samarthbhaskar.com). Letterbox doesn't have an API but they allow a zip export from the [settings](http://letterboxd.com/settings/) page. 

I wrote a quick function to create a markdown file for each review, which would play well with jekyll requirements. 

I wasn't able to create a new page and section on my blog easily, but I might tackle that later.
